The equals method in Employee class is not actually overriding the equals from Object class.
First thing the signature in equals method in Object class have object parameter, so the method is not overriding, instead 
it is overloading the method.

The solution can be something like:
@Override
	public boolean equals(Object ob) {
		Employee e = (Employee)ob;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
